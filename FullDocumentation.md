## In-progress Updates

*Last Updated 5/5/2020*

Here's my current project progress in video form: https://youtu.be/7LlGvHPOp20.

Next goal is to hard code data to populate the website by using server calls and create an extension.


## Research for the Project

At this time, the research for this project can be seen in my final paper [here](https://portfolios.cs.earlham.edu/index.php/2020/05/05/capstone-paper-a-functional-and-scale-able-user-platform-for-automatic-fake-news-detection/).   
You can also view my poster created for this project [here](https://portfolios.cs.earlham.edu/index.php/2020/05/05/capstone-poster-whos-fake-news/).

## Tools Used Throughout the Process



## Helpful Tutorials Found

## Website Creation
I started with a react template instead of starting from scratch so that I could quickly get my bearings since I only had 2 months to get this part up and running. I've put information about the template I used below.

#### React, React Router, Redux, and Redux Thunk boilerplate
* Tutorial: [Getting started with create-react-app, Redux, React Router & Redux Thunk](https://medium.com/@notrab/getting-started-with-create-react-app-redux-react-router-redux-thunk-d6a19259f71f)
* [Demo](https://create-react-app-redux.now.sh)
* Installation:  
    * ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/notrab/create-react-app-redux.git
        cd create-react-app-redux
        yarn
        ```
* [Link to fixes I needed to make to the template](#react-boilerplate-issues)

### Website Dependencies Added

* Bit
    * ```npm install bit-bin --global```
    * "Bit is an open-source cli tool for collaborating on isolated components across projects and repositories." 
    * "Use Bit to distribute discrete components from a design library or a project into a standalone reusable package and utilize it across applications."
    * [Info about Bit from npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bit-bin)
    * [Bit Documentation](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/quick-start)
    * I will use this more in the future to make sure my code is resuable.
* React-Bootstrap
    * ```npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap```
    * UI component library
    * "React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery."
    * [Info on React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app)
