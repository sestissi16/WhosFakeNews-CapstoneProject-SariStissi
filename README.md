## by Sari Stissi

## Made on top of the React, React Router, Redux, and Redux Thunk boilerplate
* Tutorial: [Getting started with create-react-app, Redux, React Router & Redux Thunk](https://medium.com/@notrab/getting-started-with-create-react-app-redux-react-router-redux-thunk-d6a19259f71f)
* [Demo](https://create-react-app-redux.now.sh)
* Installation:  
    * ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/notrab/create-react-app-redux.git
        cd create-react-app-redux
        yarn
        ```

## Installation Instructions for the Who's Fake News Project
1.  ```git clone https://gitlab.cluster.earlham.edu/sestissi16/WhosFakeNewsProject-CapstoneProject.git [your folder name you want it to be cloned to]```
2. OR ```git clone https://github.com/sestissi16/WhosFakeNewsProject-CapstoneProject.git [your folder name you want it to be cloned to]```
3. ```cd [path to your folder name that you cloned this to]```
4. Then to run this project type ```npm client-start```   

This starts only the react server because the backend server and postgress is not up and running. I should have saved all the dependencies so that there is no need to manually install all of them. If this is not the case, you can go to the dependency section of the FullDocumentation.md that is included in this repository and follow the steps I took to install them. 

In the future, you will be able to just copy and paste the link to my website to view.
